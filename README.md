🏦 Loan Status Prediction Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan approval status using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques.

The objective is to understand which factors influence loan approval decisions and build a predictive model based on those insights.

This project simulates a real-world banking loan approval system.

🎯 Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to assess whether a loan applicant is eligible for approval based on various factors such as income, credit history, and demographic details.

The goal of this project is to:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct exploratory data analysis

Apply statistical testing

Build a classification model to predict Loan Status (Approved / Not Approved)

The dataset contains the following features:

ApplicantIncome

CoapplicantIncome

LoanAmount

Loan_Amount_Term

Credit_History

Gender

Married

Education

Self_Employed

Property_Area

Loan_Status (Target Variable)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
